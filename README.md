در کل 16 تغییر انجام شده است.

## گام 2

| Principle  | Achievements  | Violations  |
|---|---|---|
| **Principle 1: Single Responsibility**  | -   | - Payment services are responsible for both registering and paying processes. Order class is responsible for two different jobs (adding food and calculating price). |
| **Principle 2: Open-Close Principle (OCP)**  | - Adding "Phone Payment" didn't changed the current logic in the main class and no modification was required.  | - For adding new methods all of the codes relating the Order Services must be modified like now that adding phone changed all the classes in the Payment Services objects. |
| **Principle 3: Liskov Substitution Principle**  | - In the implementation of the "OrderService," the interface is used, and there is an Is-A relationship between the services, so they can implement their corresponding methods.  | - None  |
| **Principle 4: Interface Segregation Principle**  | - None  | - The "OrderService" interface contains many methods that are unecessary for child classes with many of these methods having no body. |
| **Principle 5: Dependency Inversion Principle**  | - In the "Main" class, an entity of type "OrderService" is considered, allowing any type of "Order" to be assigned to it.  | - Access to the object of services directly.  |


| Principle  | Violation Description  | Proposed Solution  |
|---|---|---|
| **Single Responsibility (SRP)**  | multiple responsiblities in the Order class and services | separate register and payment to different classes, and in similar way for calculing the price and adding the price, but in this scopre it is overkilling. |
| **Open-Close Principle (OCP)**  | modification of service methods | since all service tyeps share a common attribute of registering and paying, the interface be implemented more general and with register and pay abstracct methods rather than specific and detailed methods for each class |
| **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  | OrderService has many unecessary methods that are not implemented mostly in subclasses | the solution of OCP solves this. |
| **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  | Direct access to class objects in the client side | Communication based on abstraction through the use of factory method design pattern which removes this dependency. |
